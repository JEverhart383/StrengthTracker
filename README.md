# StrengthTracker
This is the beginnings of a strength tracking app using jQuery, jQuery Mobile, and eventually d3.js to display graphs. It will have a record book for max effort lifts for all of the popular powerlifting and olympic styles, a graph that shows progress over time, and a calculator that prints out different percentages of your one rep max for training purposes.
